# Corona Tracker

This app shows an Angular Material table with the contents of [https://corona-stats.online](https://corona-stats.online/).
The lastest data is retrieved every minute so that the user does not have to refresh the screen.

- Special thanks to [sagarkarira](https://github.com/sagarkarira/coronavirus-tracker-cli).

Online version is hosted in AWS [here](http://corona-tracker-docker.eu-west-1.elasticbeanstalk.com).
